# SCRAMPLE
SCRAMPLE (score + example) is a demo application, originally based on
[ipc_bridge example application](https://github.com/eclipse-score/communication/tree/main/score/mw/com/example/ipc_bridge).

It is planned to extend the *scrample* application in the future for demonstration of
the functionality of further Eclipse S-CORE platform modules.

For detailed description of *scrample* application please refer to the S-CORE Handbook.
